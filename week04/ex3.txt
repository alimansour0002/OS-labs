so as we can see, 
the answer for n =3  equals 8 ,
the answer for n = 5 =32, 
so here, in each iteration of the loop, a new fork is called by all already existed processes, so clearly we are doubling the number of processes 
in each iteration, so the answer is always given by:
number of processes = 2 ^ n
